# MillenniumQuest
Simple 2D RPG game leveraging the ability of raylib library.

# What is this?
I got inspired from a fanart I found while scrolling with Pinterest. It's so sick, I wish someone made a videogame on them.
The game puts you into a roguelike (for now) situation with a futuristic and sci-fi style called "Millennium Science School".
And YOU plays as a Game Development Department Hero character called "Tendou Arisu".

Yes!! I love Blue Archive, the story is so damn great!!!

# Version
It's still at Alpha phase 0.1... the game hasn't finished yet (not even a prototype), but some project skeleton parts are implemented and needs to be refined!

Uhh I'm implementing the sprites first and collision logic rn.

# License
Uhhh GPL 3, so no proprietary modifications without contributing back pls :>
